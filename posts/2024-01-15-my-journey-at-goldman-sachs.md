# My Journey at Goldman Sachs: Lessons in Fintech

Working at Goldman Sachs has been an incredible experience that shaped my understanding of both finance and technology. Here are some key insights I gained during my time there.

## The Technology Stack

The financial industry relies heavily on:

```python
# Example of risk calculation system
def calculate_portfolio_risk(positions, market_data):
    total_risk = 0
    for position in positions:
        volatility = market_data[position.symbol].volatility
        exposure = position.quantity * position.price
        total_risk += exposure * volatility
    return total_risk
```

## Mathematical Foundations

One of the most important concepts in quantitative finance is the Black-Scholes equation:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - r V = 0$$

Where:
- $V$ is the option price
- $S$ is the stock price
- $r$ is the risk-free rate
- $\sigma$ is the volatility

## Key Takeaways

1. **Performance matters** - In financial systems, microseconds can mean millions
2. **Reliability is critical** - Systems must work 24/7 with minimal downtime
3. **Security first** - Every line of code is scrutinized for potential vulnerabilities

The experience taught me that building software for financial markets requires a unique combination of mathematical rigor, engineering excellence, and business acumen.
