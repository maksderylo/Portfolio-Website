    "content": "# Purpose\n\nIn order to avoid either manual checks requiring each student to run the tools on their machines continuously throughout the project, or refactoring to adhere to the standards before submission, following this tutorial this process can be automated to have the checks continuously run on each pull request.\n\nThe guidelines we were given for our Software Engineering Project (SEP) are as follows:\n![img_1.png](img_1.png)\n\nAnd most of these can be checked and reported on automatically.\nAn example in our frontend:\n![img.png](img.png)\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, I will guide through the steps needed to set up automatic code quality checks, on the example of our setup for frontend, but I specify each place where this template can be adjusted to your project.\n\nFor example in our repository, we have seperated the code into three folders:\n- `frontend/` - Angular frontend (JavaScript, TypeScript)\n- `backend/` - Flask backend (.NET)\n- 'model/' - ML models (Python)\nAnd thus created checks for each of these folders separately.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n- A GitHub repository for your project. \n(In case you chose to use GitLab or Bitbucket, the steps will be similar, but the tutorial is tailored to GH.)\n- Understand from Scitools license\n  (Single student rather than entire developing team needs to acquire it, it's reused on every run)\n\n# Steps\nTo quickly summarize the steps needed to set up the checks:\n1. Acquire a license for Understand from Scitools.\n2. Add the license to your repository secrets.\n3. Specify commands, paths, and languages to run Understand and Simian checks.\n4. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file.\n5. Few repo tweaks.\n\n## Step 1 - Acquire a license for Understand from Scitools\n\nYou can acquire a free license for Understand from Scitools as a student. Follow the instructions on their website: https://scitools.com/student\n\n## Step 2 - Add the license to your repository secrets\n\nOnce you have the license string, navigate to your GitHub repository, go to \"Settings\" > \"Secrets and variables\" > \"Actions\", and under \"Repository secrets\" add a new secret named `UNDERSTAND_LICENSE` with the license string as its value.\n\n## Step 3 - Add python script, specify commands, paths, and languages to run Understand and Simian checks\n\nBefore creating the workflow file, we need to prepare a few things in the repository.\n\n1. Create a folder `.github/quality_tools/` in your repository to store the necessary files.\n2. Add to that folder a Python script `parse_metrics.py` to parse the metrics CSV file generated by Understand into a markdown format suitable for GitHub comments. You can download the ready-made script here: [download parse_metrics.py](downloads/parse_metrics.py).\n\n> Place it in `.github/quality_tools/parse_metrics.py` in your repository.\n\nNext, we have to specify the commands for Understand to run the analysis. We create a template file named `frontend_commands.txt` in the same `.github/quality_tools/` folder.\n\n```aiignore\ncreate -languages Web frontend_metrics.und #TODO: Adjust the name and language\n-db frontend_metrics.und #TODO: Adjust the name if you have changed it above\nadd frontend/src\nsettings -MetricShowAggregatedFileMetrics on\nsettings -MetricShowAggregatedClassMetrics on\nsettings -MetricShowCouplingAndCohesionMetrics on\nsettings -MetricShowInheritanceMetrics on\nsettings -MetricShowStatementCountMetrics on\nsettings -MetricCyclomatic all\nsettings -MetricShowDefaultSummaryMetrics on\nanalyze\nmetrics\nreport\n```\nHere to adjust to your project, you might want to change:\n1. Language (e.g. `-languages C++` for C++ projects), we use 'Web' for our frontend project. List of supported languages can be found [here](https://support.scitools.com/support/solutions/articles/70000582794-supported-languages)\n2. Not needed but you can also adjust the name of the database, but it should match in both places, and will have to be adjusted in templats later.\n\n## Step 4 - Create a GitHub Actions workflow file\n\nEither manually in a folder `.github/workflows/` or using the GitHub interface, create a new workflow file named `code_quality.yml`.\nThis will serve as the configuration for the CI pipeline, which we use to run checks but can be extended to do more in the future, this tutorial serves as a basis for creation just for code quality checks.\n\n\nHere I provide a sample workflow file for our frontend that you can use as a starting point. You can customize it according to your project's needs.\nLook at the comments (specifically those starting with `TODO`) for places where you might want to/should adjust the configuration.\n\n[download frontend_code_quality_job.yml](downloads/frontend_code_quality_job.yml)\n\n> Make sure it is in `.github/workflows` folder.\n\n## Step 5 - Few repo tweaks\n\n1. Go to your repository settings, under \"Actions\" > \"General\", and ensure that \"Read and write permissions\" is selected for the workflow permissions. This is necessary for the workflow to post comments on pull requests.\n2. ...?\n\n# Done!\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, every time a pull request is created or updated in your repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run the code quality checks using Understand and Simian. The results will be posted as a comment on the pull request, allowing you to easily see any issues that need to be addressed before merging.\n\nAdditionally, you can inspect the results by downloading the artifact uploaded by the job when it succeeds:\n![img_2.png](img_2.png)\n\nUnzip and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the full report:\n![img_3.png](img_3.png)"
