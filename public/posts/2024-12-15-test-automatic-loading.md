# Test Post: Automatic Markdown Loading

This post was created as a simple markdown file and should be automatically loaded by the blog system.

## Features

The system now supports:

### Code Blocks
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from a markdown file!")
    return "success"
```

### Mathematical Equations
The Fibonacci sequence can be defined as:
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

Where $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.

### Lists and Formatting
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `inline code`
- [External links](https://example.com)

## Conclusion

This demonstrates that markdown files are now automatically discovered and loaded into the blog system!
